This repository has all of my algorithms from my computer science class at Ball State University in the spring of 2017. The base code and tests were built by Nicholas Renet. The assignments come from "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.

I have recently added practice algorithms from freeCodeCamp.com, testdome.com, and the text "Elements of Programming Interviews in Python" by Adnan Aziz, Tsung-Hsien Lee, and Amit Prakash.

Currently, I'm working through a linear algebra course through the University of Austin, Texas. The program uses MatLab to show algorithms, but I decided to rewrite those functions into Python.
